    "# Funding and Publication\n",
    "In this case study, we want to find out the relationship between funding and publications. Later on, we will introduce more advanced analysis of the data, but the first step is to collect the data! The HW01 folder on Canvas provides a csv file that contains recent NIH awards of faculty and students from Harvard University. This list is provided by NIH. However, it did not provide the publications of each awardee. We will use PubMed as a complementary source of data. For simplicity, we will focus on the number of publications of each awardee only.\n",
